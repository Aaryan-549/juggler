/**
 * Reply-suggestions setting — a client-side mirror of the global
 * `reply_suggestions_disabled` credential, for synchronous reads on the
 * turn-end path.
 *
 * Unlike auto-naming, nothing server-side reads this key: the suggestions are
 * generated in the browser, so this cache IS the setting as far as the running
 * feature is concerned. The server only persists it, and hands it back in the
 * `/api/config` payload.
 *
 * The cache starts UNSEEDED rather than defaulting to on, which is the one way
 * it deliberately differs from {@link module:services/auto-name-setting}. The
 * feature is on by default, but "on by default" must not mean "on before we
 * have looked": a user who turned suggestions off would otherwise get one
 * round of them on every startup, in the window before `/api/config` lands.
 * A setting whose entire job is making something stop cannot have a gap like
 * that, and the cost of the stricter rule is only that the very first turn of
 * a session may pass unsuggested.
 *
 * The same switch ("Suggest prompts") also governs the starter prompts an
 * empty conversation offers (utils/starter-prompts.js), which share the
 * suggestions row. Those are drawn rather than generated, so they need telling
 * when the setting moves: {@link REPLY_SUGGESTIONS_SETTING_EVENT}.
 * @module services/reply-suggestions-setting
